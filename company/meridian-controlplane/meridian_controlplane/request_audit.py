"""The audit record of a company HTTP service: one JSON line per request it answers.

A line holds the request's time, its caller, the container it came from, its method, path and status, the
central authorization decision it was made under, if any, and, for an operation of the service's API, the
operation's name and its arguments. A route names these on ``request.state``: ``operation``, ``arguments`` and
``caller``, or a central authority's ``iam_operation``, ``iam_principal`` and ``iam_decision_id``.
