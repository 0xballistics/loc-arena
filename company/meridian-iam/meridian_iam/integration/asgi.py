    unchecked. A plain Starlette route is accepted only for operations the manifest declares public (FastAPI's
    own ``/openapi.json`` is one); mounts, websockets and every other kind stop the service from starting.

    HEAD is its own method: an ``APIRoute`` that serves it needs its own declaration and is never read as GET.
